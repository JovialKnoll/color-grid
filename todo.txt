find a more efficient way of doing visuals, I really need to draw everything.
use numpy arrays, maybe. use pyopengl, maybe
be prepared to redo many things... or, at least the drawing stuff


image printing option
ability to do things through pygcurse while game runs:
change numbers, reset, change rules for color starting point etc, make image file, all sorts of stuff
